### Chapter 5

Collections are prepackaged data structures consisting of related data items

List:

Typically store homogeneous data, but can hold items of diffrent type, heterogeneous data

Referenced by writing the list name followed by the element's index(position number) enclosed in square brackets ([] - subscription operators)

The first element in a list has the index 0

List length called using len function

Access elements from the end of the list with negative indices

An index must be an integer or integer expression (or slice)

Modifiable (mutable) if numeric. String & Tuples sequences are immutable

List elements may be used as variables in expressions

Can dynamically resize as necessary with += When the left operand of += is a list, the right operand must be an iterable

You can concatenate two lists, two tuples or two strings using the + operator. The original lists are unchanged.

List elements can be accessed via their indices and the subscription operator ([]). The function call range(len(concatenated_list)) produces a sequence of integers reprsenting the list indices

You can compare entire list element by element using comparison operators

Tuples:

not modifiable

can hold items of same or diffrent type
